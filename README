pacemaker-snmp
==============

This project add SNMP support to the pacemaker Cluster Resource Manager.

Thank for volunteering as a alpha tester for the SNMP agent software for the 
pacemker cluster resource agent.

The software, at the moment, is four files:
- SYS4.mib: The MIB for my company providing the basic OID structure.
- PACEMAKER.mib: The MIB for pacemaker.
- pcmk-subagent.pl The SNMP agent.
- This README.


Installation:
1) Install and configure net-snmp properly. You should be able to get data 
when you walk the interface table:

# snmpwalk <clusternode> ifTable

Be sure your snmp agent runs as root, not as user snmp. You need to be root to 
get cluster information.


2) Copy the MIB files to the location where MIBs reside in your system. In 
most systems this will be /usr/share/snmp/mibs, but in Debian-based systems 
this is under /usr/share/mibs/* subdirectories.

Please make sure that your systems knows about the new MIBs. An easy 
way on the management station is to enter:

# export MIBS=+ALL
# export MIBDIRS=+<your MIB directory>

in the shell you are working. On the cluster node you need to copy the files
into that directory where your system read the MIBs from when the agent is starting.

Your system should give reasonable results entering the command:

# snmptranslate -IR -Tp sys4Pacemaker

The installation of the MIBs is only nescessary on the computer that you send 
the SNMP requests from, i.e. your management station. It is not nescessary on 
the cluster nodes.


3) Copy the perl file to /usr/local/sbin directory of your cluster nodes.


4) Add the line

perl do '/usr/local/sbin/pcmk-subagent.pl'

to the configuration of your snmp agent, i.e. to /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf and 
restart the snmpd.

For debugging you also could start the snmpd daemon in the forground, not as a 
background service:

# snmpd -f -Lo

5) Perhaps you have to install some perl moules. I use:

use NetSNMP::agent::Support;
use NetSNMP::ASN (':all');
use XML::Simple;
use Switch;
use POSIX qw(uname);
use List::Util qw(first);


6) Retrive the data:

# snmpwalk <clusternode> sys4Pacemaker


Have fun! I would be happy about any comments, improvements, whishes and 
feedback. Any OIDs missing? Do you want to have more data delivered by the 
agent?

Please do not distribute the program further. The OIDs of pacemaker are not on 
the right place. The program is alpha. No (future: GPL) copyright notice 
included, and so on. Thanks.
